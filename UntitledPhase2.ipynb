I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a \"Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?\" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money.

       "\"Outstanding food, friendly service!  We have been here twice - the first time on a coupon that was through one of the val-pak type of distributors.  My husband is Italian, so we are always looking for local places to try. His acid test is the Ravioli.  His grandmother made them from scratch every day and them memory of them is still his gold standard for great Italian food.  He rates these 90% Nona, which is quite an honor - there's only been one other place we've tried that has gotten such a high rating and that was in Italy.\\n\\nI had the Carbonara, which is done differently than I'd had it before, with no cheese in the sauce, just the butter and egg and a *mound* of pancetta and peas, served with a poached egg on top.  It looked (and tasted) so good that my husband had it when we came back on Tuesday night. He wasn't disappointed. Portions are HUGE, so you will have leftovers for lunch - maybe twice if you order something as rich as the Carbonara.  I opted for the Pappardelle Bolognese with peppers and onions on our second visit, and it was delish - I had to make myself stop eating.\\n\\nMy only concern is that the place was empty on Tuesday except for us - I guess everyone was waiting for Valentine's day, but I am really hoping that nothing happens to this place - it's terrific and we will be back often.\""
